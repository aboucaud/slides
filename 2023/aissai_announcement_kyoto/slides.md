# AISSAI semester in 2023

AISSAI is a new CNRS interdisciplinary initiative started in 2021 to encourage .blue[**synergies between CNRS domain scientists and machine learning specialists**].

The way AISSAI is promoting these .blue[**connexions on an international level**] is through the funding of .red[**scientific semesters**].

Each semester is built by a CNRS institute to gather the international community around its current most relevant themes.

IN2P3 has been assigned the semester of Fall 2023, which David Rousseau (IJCLab) and I are supervising through the [IN2P3 Machine Learning master project][website].
